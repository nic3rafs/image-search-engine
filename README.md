# Image Search Engine with Weaviate, Express, and Next.js
This project is a simple TypeScript web application that allows users to upload, display, delete, and find similar images using Next.js for the frontend, Weaviate as the backend for storing image metadata, and Express as an API backend.
Inspired by the Fireship [video](https://youtu.be/mBcBoGhFndY).

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Server setup
1. Go to the server folder: `cd server`
2. Install all dependencies: `npm i`
  
>I suggest you to run Weaviate locally in Docker:
>- Go to the Weaviate folder: `cd weaviate`
>- Download Docker images and run a container: `docker-compose up -d`

1. Set up your Weaviate client in the `utils/utils.ts` (if you are running locally in Docker, you don't need to change anything)
2. Add a schema to your database: `node weaviate/schema.js`
3. Run the server: `npm run dev`

### Client setup
1. Go to the client folder: `cd client`
2. Install all dependencies: `npm i`
3. Run the frontend locally: `npm run dev`
